
The jumping functionality was tested quite thoroughly before it worked.

The first phase was receiving input, which was tested quite simply:
First I set the program to run the movement actions without waiting for input,
so that I knew the player would move properly.
Then I set up the player to wait for keyboard input, and ran the program, but the player wouldn't move.
I solved the issue which related to focus and then tested again.
It solved the problem and the player was responding perfect to keyboard input.

The second phase was adding jumping in addition to the simple left and right movement.
Input was working fine and the jump animated well after my first execution of the program.
Three variables affect the controls of the jump, 
-one is how fast you are moving at the start of a jump, 
-one is how quickly you are pulled back into a fall, 
-and one is air resistance which combined with the gravity determines how fast you end up falling.
I just experimented with the values, and since I knew what they do I was able to easily interpret the movement 
and over several executions, work out the ideal settings for each.
