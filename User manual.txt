
Fall

Press space bar to start the game initially.
Control the little square with A and D.
While you stand on a platform you will gain height.
When you start to get too high, move your player off and try to land on a lower platform.
You can move left and right while falling.
Avoid falling off the bottom of the screen, or floating away or you will have to restart.

Jump to gain a little bit of height, using W, but most drops should be possible without this.

If you fall off the screen press escape to restart instantly.
