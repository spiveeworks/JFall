
This project is an acceptable base for this format of game.

I used principles of OOP to make my code reusable and extendible, 
which means that although deeper functionality is missing from the project,
it would be trivial to implement.

I had brief difficulty with keyboard input but when I finally managed to follow instructions given,
it behaved as expected.

There are only two things that I would change about this project.
First I would separate the Applet code from the code defining 
the various game objects by making a separate .java class.
Second I would make platforms not on the screen detach from the player:
currently the player protects their platform from being garbage-collected.
By testing the player's platform location I could make the game actually challenging.

In fact the original design said that touching the top of the screen would be an end condition,
which is not in any way implemented here.
The original design also suggested variety in platforms, and a collectible scoring system.
This would mainly involve creating modified subclasses of Platform, which would not be challenging, 
but isn't a major extension in terms of the software and algorithm. 
(although it is interesting how trivial extensions to the code can provide the variety that would
make this an interesting, playable game.)

Through this project I have learned about the Java environment, and how Java achieves
its graphical interfacing requirements using interfaces and adapter classes.
This is a very eye-opening contrast to the C-Win32 graphics api which is much more focussed on
functional programming rather than adaptable object oriented approaches.
